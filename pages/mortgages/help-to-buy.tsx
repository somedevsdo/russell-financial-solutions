              This is a Government backed scheme introduced in April 2013 designed to help first
              time buyers or home movers to purchase a property up to the value of Â£600,000. There
              are 2 Phases
            </p>
            <h2>Phase 1</h2>
            <p>
              The government will give you an equity loan of 20% of the property value and you would
              put in 5%. The 25% deposit means that you will have many lenders available and because
              of the deposit you will have a good range of interest rates available.
            </p>
            <p>
              The government loan is interest-free for the first five years and borrowers will be
              charged a fee of 1.75% each year, this figure will rise in line with the Retail Prices
              Index each year after this.
            </p>
            <h2>Phase 2</h2>
            <p>
              The Government gave another option to lenders. They would guarantee the mortgage
              against negative equity. You can put a 5% deposit and there will be no Mortgages
              Indemnity Premium as the Government Guarantees the mortgage. Bringing in Phase 2 meant
              that lenders are more secure and so made 95% mortgages more favourable.
