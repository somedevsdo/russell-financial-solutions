            <p>
              Shared ownership is another avenue for people to get on the ladder. You purchase a
              share of the property with a mortgage and the remaining share you pay rent on. The
              rent is paid to whoever jointly owns the property. This is where some advice is needed
              as you really need to look at all your options.
